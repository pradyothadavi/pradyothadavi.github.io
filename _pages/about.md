Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer and engineering leader with a keen interest in game theory, graphs, and blockchain technology.

My [career](/cv), spanning a decade, has been with [Flipkart](https://www.flipkartcareers.com/#!/) in the Fintech and Payments domain. Currently, I am an Engineering Manager responsible for the Risk and Fraud engineering team.

I hold a Master's degree (M.Tech in Information Technology, 2014) from [IIIT Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/). I completed my schooling in [Dandeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandeli), a small town nested in the Western Ghats. While I am a native of [Lingasugur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingasugur), Bengaluru has been my second home since 2007.
