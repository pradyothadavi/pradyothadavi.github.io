Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am an Engineering Manager in Fintech and Payments Group ( FPG ) at Flipkart. Me and my team are responsible for democratising data for creating user insights. I have a patent filed for System And Method For Facilitating Data Sharing ( Application No: 202141031528 ) with Indian Patent Office.

I have a Masters degree (M.Tech in Information Technology, 2014) from [IIIT Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), Karnataka in 2011. I completed my schooling at [Dandeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandeli), a small town in the Western Ghats region. While I am a native of [Lingasugur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingasugur), Bengaluru has been my second home since 2017.

My interests are in the area of distributed systems, big data, graphs and blockchain.
